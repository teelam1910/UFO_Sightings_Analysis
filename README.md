## Project Description
We investigated UFO sightings and their frequencies. Our aim is to determine which states have the most UFO sightings and which have the fewest. Secondary to this, weâ€™ll analyze data to determine if UFO sightings are most common in the United States of America or other countries. We will use a comprehensive dataset from the National UFO Reporting Center and generate visuals based on our findings with Python, SQL, Data Visualization, and Project Management.
